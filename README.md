Bulk Edit (module for Omeka S)
==============================

[Bulk Edit] is a module for [Omeka S] that adds tools to bulk edit resources in
order to modify or to clean them.

Current processes are:

- Replace value of a property (directly or via regex)
- Remove the literal value of a property
- Prepend or append a string to a value of a property
- Set or remove language of a property
- Order values by language (in particular for the title)
- Displace values from a property to another one
- Set visibility of a property public or private
- Update the media html of an item
- Remove all trailing white spaces
- Remove duplicate values

Furthermore, values are automatically trimmed and deduplicated when a resource
is saved.


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder `BulkEdit`.

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module] and follow the
config instructions.


Usage
-----

The tool is available via the standard bulk process in Admin > Items, Admin > Item Sets,
and Admin > Media. Simply select specific resources or all, then click Go, then
select and config the process to do.

To improve search of resources, you can use module [Advanced Search Plus], that
allows to search by creation date, modification date, or by visibility.

The job is launched directly when specific resources are selected, and in the
background when all resources are selected.

### Trim property values

Remove leading and trailing whitespaces preventively on any resource creation or
update, or curatively via the batch edit, so values will be easier to find and
to compare exactly (fix [#1258]). Note that the curative trimming uses a regex
when possible (with mysql ≥ 8.0.4 or mariadb ≥ 10.0.5). There is no difference
in most of the cases, except when there are multiple whitespace mixed (space,
tabulation, new line, end of line, etc.).

### Deduplicate property values

Remove exact duplicated values on any new or updated resource preventively.
Note: preventive deduplication is case sensitive, but curative deduplication is
case insensitive (it uses a direct query and the Omeka database is case
insensitive by default).

### Replace value of a property directly or via regex

Fill fields "Replace" and "By", specify the type of replacement (simple, html or
regex), then select the properties to update.

The mode "html" means that the original string will be checked as raw string and
as html encoded string too. For example, string `café` will be checked with
`café` and `caf&eacute;`). Be careful when simple characters are mixed with
entities, it may be difficult to replace all strings. The replacement string is
used unchanged, so it is recommended to use entities for it too.

### Remove the literal value of a property

Simply check the box "Remove string", then select the properties to update.
The string will be removed, but it can be prepended or appended with another
string. In that case, the value is kept, else it is removed.

### Prepend or append a string

Fill fields "Prepend" and/or "Append" and select the properties to update.

### Set or remove language of a property

Select the properties to set or remove language.
Note: all values of the selected properties are updated, so be aware of existing
languages when they are multiple.

# Order values by language

Sometime, we need that the title and the description to be displayed to be in
one language, but the value in this language is not always the first in the
metadata. This is important for the title and the description, that are
displayed in many places.

So just write the language in the order you want for the properties you want.
Values with other languages or without language will be kept after.

### Set or unset visibility of a property

Select the properties to set or unset visibility.

# Displace values from a property to another one

Select the source properties and the destination property, then process edit.
Some filters (datatype, language, string, visibility) allows to move only
selected values.

# Explode a value into multiple values

This tool is useful for an import of a csv file, where the checkbox for "multivalue"
was missed. Select the properties and the separator, that may have multiple
character.

# Merge two values as uri

Select the properties and their values will be merged two by two. This tool can
only be used when the number of values is even. When a value has already the
datatype "uri" with a label, it is not changed and all values of the property
are skipped to avoid merge issues. When two uris follow each other, the property
is skipped too. At least one value should be an url. When the label and the
values are different urls, the property is skipped. It’s recommended to check
order of values first.

# Convert datatype

Select the source datatype and the new datatype. Only some datatype are managed
currently .

### Update media html from item

Select the items and update media html, then update it like an item value.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
